IRIS data Set Classification.
***
       The main concempt behind this is that we have classified the IRIS flower species data 
       using Logistic Regression  as well as Random forest Classification and to find out which 
       model gives high accuracy.

## Documentation

We loaded the data set in as panda farme work.
Then we checked our data for any missing values.
Then checked the outliers . and removed the same with help of IQR (inter Quantile range )
method. 
Then we checked your data skewness wich seems to completely fine.
After that I have imported suome of the libaries from Sklearn.
Then split the data into Trainning and Testing data set . Also seperated the Independent and Dependent features.
Then used Logistic regression and Random Forest Classifier to train the model.
